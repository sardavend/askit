# README
WIP [DRAFT]

This project aims to be an open-source alternative to services like pdf.ai and similars, its more like an experiment to see how far
I can get in building a knowledge database using only the plain old rails and Postgres, and a 'little' help of OpenAI embeddings API

# Main Dependencies
* A Postgres instance with pg_vector
* A OpenIA API key(for using the embedding and chat APIs)
* React, only for rendering the pdf viewer
